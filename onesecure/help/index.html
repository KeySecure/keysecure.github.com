          <p>Select timeout type, you can change how long OneSecure can be open and unused before it locks. If you carry your iOS device with you wherever you go, you may want OneSecure to lock sooner.

        <h3>Hide Passwords</h3>
          <p>"Hide Passwords" settings allow you to reveal or conceal your passwords all of the time.</p>
          <p>OneSecure conceals your passwords by default, which means they are displayed as a series of dots to make sure they're safe from prying eyes. If you wish to reveal all of your passwords all of the time, switch Hide Password off.</p>
          
        <h3>Delete all data on login failure</h3>
          <p>Tap this option, then confirm by tapping on Erase Data in the alert that appears to delete your OneSecure data from your device.

        <h3>Integrated web browser</h3>
